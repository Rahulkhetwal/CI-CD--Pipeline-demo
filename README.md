# CI/CD Pipeline Demo

## Overview

Welcome to the **CI/CD Pipeline Demo**! This project showcases a simple application integrated with a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The primary goal is to demonstrate automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying applications.

## Features

- **Application Functionality:** A demo application that illustrates basic operations and functionality.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates the build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions.
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js, GitHub Actions, [also,add any other technologies you used].

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahulkhetwal/CI-CD--Pipeline-demo.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:

###  Running the Application
1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ```
2. Access the app: Open your browser and navigate to
    'http://localhost:3000' (or the port your app is running on).

###  Running Tests
1. Execute tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
                                                                                                                                                                                              ```
###  CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions to automate various stages of the application lifecycle:

  * Workflow File: '.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml'
  * Current Status: The pipeline is set up but currently has some configuration issues. We are actively working on resolving these to ensure smooth automation.

###  Troubleshooting
  * Common Issues: If you encounter issues, please check the Troubleshooting Guide for possible solutions or open an issue in the repository.

###  Future Work
  * Pipeline Enhancements: Plans to fix and improve the CI/CD pipeline configuration to ensure complete automation.
  * Additional Features: Exploring additional features to enhance the application and its deployment process.
